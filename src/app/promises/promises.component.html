        <h5 class="card-title">Promises</h5>
        <h6 class="card-text">A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
